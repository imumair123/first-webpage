        The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system.
        The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate.
        It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. 
        The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.

        Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.
        At the center is the Moon’s dense, metallic core. The core is largely composed of iron and some nickel.
        The inner core is a solid mass about 480 km in diameter. Surrounding the solid inner core is a fluid outer core, that brings the total diameter of the core to about 660 km.
        The Moon’s core is small (about 20% of the Moons diameter) as opposed to other terrestrial worlds (like the Earth) with cores measuring closer to 50% of their diameters
      

        VIEWING MODE:

        The Moon is Earth’s constant companion, the first skywatching target pointed out to us as children. 
        We watch its face change as the month progresses, and see patterns and pictures in its geological features.
        
        It’s the object in the night sky that humanity knows best ― and the one that’s easiest to study. 
        Whether your tools are a telescope, a pair of binoculars, or just your eyes, you can find plenty of features on the Moon.

        Like the four inner planets, the moon is rocky. It's pockmarked with craters formed by asteroid impacts millions of years ago. 
        Because there is no weather, the craters have not eroded.
        The average composition of the lunar surface by weight is roughly 43 percent oxygen, 20 percent silicon, 19 percent magnesium, 10 percent iron, 3 percent calcium, 3 percent aluminum, 0.42 percent chromium, 0.18 percent titanium and 0.12 percent manganese.
        Orbiters have found traces of water on the lunar surface that may have originated from deep underground. 
        They have also located hundreds of pits that could house explorers who remain on the moon long-term.
        
        Deep moonquakes, occurring broadly around 700 km beneath the lunar surface are tidal events, caused by the pull of Earth’s gravity tugging and stretching the internal structures of the Moon.
        Moonquakes originating on or near the surface can be caused by meteoroid impacts with the Moon.
        Another type of extremely shallow moonquake can come from thermal expansion and contraction of rock on or near the surface as it goes from the extremely frigid lunar night to the very hot lunar daytime.
        A fourth type of moonquake originates at the moderately shallow depths of 20-30 km, can register up to a startling 5.5 on the Richter scale, and can last for over 10 minutes! The causes of this fourth type of moonquake are still being investigated.

        Moons — also called natural satellites — come in many shapes, sizes and types. They are generally solid bodies, and few have atmospheres. Most planetary moons probably formed from the discs of gas and dust circulating around planets in the early solar system.
         There are hundreds of moons in our solar system — even a few asteroids have been found to have small companion moons. Moons that begin with a letter and a year are considered provisional moons. They will be given a proper name when their discoveries are confirmed by additional observations.
         Of the terrestrial (rocky) planets of the inner solar system, neither Mercury nor Venus have any moons at all, Earth has one and Mars has its two small moons.
          In the outer solar system, the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune have dozens of moons. As these planets grew in the early solar system, they were able to capture smaller objects with their large gravitational fields.

         Earth's Moon probably formed when a large body about the size of Mars collided with Earth, ejecting a lot of material from our planet into orbit. Debris from the early Earth and the impacting body accumulated to form the Moon approximately 4.5 billion years ago (the age of the oldest collected lunar rocks). Twelve American astronauts landed on the Moon during NASA's Apollo program from 1969 to 1972, studying the Moon and bringing back rock samples.
         Usually the term moon brings to mind a spherical object, like Earth's Moon.
         The two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, are different. While both have nearly circular orbits and travel close to the plane of the planet's equator, they are lumpy and dark. Phobos is slowly drawing closer to Mars and could crash into the planet in 40 or 50 million years.
         Or the planet's gravity might break Phobos apart, creating a thin ring around Mars.

         Saturn has two ocean moons—Enceladus and Titan. Both have subsurface oceans and Titan also has surface seas of lakes of ethane and methane. 
         The chunks of ice and rock in Saturn's rings (and the particles in the rings of the other outer planets) are not considered moons, yet embedded in Saturn's rings are distinct moons or moonlets.
         These shepherd moons help keep the rings in line. Titan, the second largest in the solar system, is the only moon with a thick atmosphere.
